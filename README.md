Build a twitterish app for practice, I messed up last time so decided to redo with my knowledge and make it a bit more foolproof and refined. I have more ideas of where I want to go with this project now so can implement them from the beginning.

I have already covered;
* Creating rails projects (Obviously)
* Deploying to Heroku
* Using gems
* Routes
* MVC
* Creating test specs
* Test Driven Development
* Using capybara to test forms
* Creating static pages
* Using Guard and Spork
* Using Bootstrap
* Using layout shims and partials
* Sassing up stylesheets
* Nested CSS
* Advanced routes and dynamic routes
* Refactoring test spec using utilities
* Added dynamic 'users' controller
* Refactored my test spec even more using shared tests
* Added user model
* Using annotate to make my life easier
* Basic format validation and testing of the validation
* Uniqueness validation and testing thereof
* Using full REST routes
* Using Factories in rspec tests
* Strong parameters
* Flash and error/success messages
* Resource routing
* Sessions
* Forms and submissions
* Cookies in rails
* Cucumber and BDD development
* Updating Attributes
* Using HTTP requests in rspec
* Friendly Forwarding
* Authorization and limiting access
* Test data using faker
* Pagination
